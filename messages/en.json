    "quote1": "Since joining our team, Çağlar has stood out from the very first weeks with his curiosity, fast learning ability, and calm demeanor. He quickly grasps problems, asks the right questions, and strips away unnecessary complexity to present clear and focused solutions. What impressed me was not only his willingness to say 'I don’t know' and ask for help, but also how quickly he shared what he learned with the team and contributed to the project with enthusiasm.\n\nHe communicates strongly with product and design teams, clarifies expectations early, and makes potential risks visible. He takes ownership of the tasks he undertakes and delivers on them.\n\nIn a short time, he has moved far beyond the ‘junior’ label; today, he is a reliable developer the team can count on. Working with him is a pleasure, and his character is admirable. I wholeheartedly recommend him.",

    "quote2": "I worked with Çağlar on frontend development projects where he demonstrated strong skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, React/Next.js, and Vue.js. Despite being early in his career, he consistently delivered quality code and took ownership of his tasks.\n\nÇağlar built responsive interfaces using Ant Design and TailwindCSS that helped improve our user engagement metrics. He adapted well between different frameworks and actively participated in code reviews, always eager to learn and implement feedback. His contributions to improving our development workflows showed great initiative for a junior developer.\n\nHaving studied with Çağlar at Ege University, I know him as a hard-working and dedicated person. He brings this same commitment to his professional work. His technical abilities combined with his positive attitude and willingness to learn made him a valuable team member.\n\nI recommend Çağlar for any frontend developer role. He's a motivated developer with solid skills across multiple frameworks who will continue to grow and contribute effectively to any team.",
